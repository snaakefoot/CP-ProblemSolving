# Competitive Programming and Problem Solving 

This repository contains my competitive programming solutions and resources, primarily from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) (main: [**snakefoot**](https://codeforces.com/profile/snakefoot) , alts: [**snakeleg**](https://codeforces.com/profile/snakeleg) , [**SnakeArm**](https://codeforces.com/profile/SnakeArm) ) and [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/snakefoot).

## Structure

- **Solutions**: Code for individual problems, organized by platform and problem ID/title.
- **Resources**: Notes and references on algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.
- **Templates**: Reusable snippets for common tasks (e.g., I/O handling, modular arithmetic).

## Usage

- Browse **Solutions** for problem-specific code.
- Check **Resources** for study material.
- Refer to **Templates** for coding shortcuts.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to suggest improvements or open issues.
